My first repository
**Akame ga Kill**
*i watched that anime series back when i was in grade 7*
1. it's very traumatic
2. you'll learn that love has no bound
3. people are selfish and self-centered
4. a lot of people you love may die at anytime
5. people you thought are nice are actually the most evil there is

`it was a great anime`

~hundred percent would reccomend.~
